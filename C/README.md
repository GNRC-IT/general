C
=======================
This directory contains coding in C that I have done.

Till now the codes in "Project Euler" and "Codechef" are done to get fast results. They are not according to readability factors and other best practices.

The codes in "Particular Algorithms" are written accroding to best practices. 

My coding Style:

The braces use a consistent style but in case of single statement following a loop or if-else statement I use braces-style which is something like K&R.
