####Python
- Code in Python is in both Python 2.7.5 and 3. The 3 version used was 3.3.2 and now 3.4.0
- I am mostly done with porting Python2 code to Python3. Some porting is still remaining. I just may leave it for a while.

- There are few solutions to Codechef practice problems also from http://www.codechef.com/
- It contains some Python scripts that I used as utilities like mass renaming of folders contained in zip files.
- Some minor projects like parsing webpages to get growth of website, simple WIP pong game are also present

####C
