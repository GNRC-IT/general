general
=======
This repository currently contains Python and C code. 

####Python
- Code in Python is in both Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.2.
- Python code contains solutions to around 50-60 Project Euler problems from http://projecteuler.net/problems
- There are few solutions to Codechef practice problems also from http://www.codechef.com/
- I am slowly porting Python2 code to Python3. I am writing test cases for the Python3 functions that I am writing
- There's a little testing framework that I thought of writing mainly for numerical functions. A few bits and pieces
- It contains some Python scripts that I used as utilities like mass renaming of folders contained in zip files.
- 2 minor projects are also present in Python3 folder - One of them(downloading a website) is just in beginning and other is a small one made for plotting graphs
- A few experiments in making games is also present. A somewhat functioning pong game is present. It has been on hold because I had to start learning Java.

####C
- There are some implementations of standard algorithms and data structures
- Some solutions to project euler and codechef problems are also present. Be warned these were not optimized and not necessarily following best practices.

####C++
- NOTHING present so don't look in the Cpp folder

####Java
- Contains a generic DAO layer. It has basic functionality. I am looking into ways to refactor it to a better design
